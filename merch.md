==- :icon-light-bulb: Important information when considering to order items

#### Delivery Types

| Delivery Types             | Value        | Shipping Speed | Offered as Option | Mode of Tranportation { class="compact" } |
|---|---|---|---|---| 
| Surface Mail               | Lowest-Cost  | Slowest        | Offered           | :ship:                |
| SAL (Economic Airmail)     | Low-Cost     | Slow^2^        | Not Offered^1^    | :airplane:            |    
| Airmail                    | High-Cost    | Fast           | Offered           | :airplane:            |
| EMS (Express Mail Service) | Highest-Cost | Fastest        | Offered           | :airplane:            |

1. The option for SAL shipments are temporarily unavailable due to covid protocols. You can find JP Post's service availability by country [here](https://www.post.japanpost.jp/int/information/overview_en.html)  
2. Combine the reasonable"ish" rate of surface, with somewhat the faster duration of airmail, but still less priority than airmail

- Aside from Japan post you also have your usual private couriers, like DHL, FEDEX, UPS, etc. They are also  very expensive, you will have to go to their respective site to see their policies and prices they offer, or at checkout, storefronts usual show the full price of shipping in your country.
- When it comes to customs, make sure to see your own country's customs information.

#### Agent Types

- **Forwarder**
    - Goods/Items you can buy from Japan, but the service or person won't ship overseas, in that case, you rely on a forwarder, they give you a temporary Japanese address, and with that address, you then ship the goods you buy to them, the forwarder will charge you storage fees + international shipping to send goods/item to you. You can simply think of this someone that literally ships the goods to you, because you need an address.
- **Proxy**
    - Someone in your behalf that buys, accepts, and ships the goods to you, unlike a forwarder. Generally, recommended for beginners (especially if you are nervous about buying stuff online), however more expensive. They will charge you the purchase fees for the goods + domestic shipping + international shipping fees + any additional fees as per their policy.
