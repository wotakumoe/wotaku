## Anime

#### Release group
The individual or team behind the release, also called Encoder in the case of encodes. Example: SubsPlease, Erai-raws, EMBER, Yameii etc. Sometimes, the release group name is mentioned at the end.

#### Source
The origin of the release, so streaming sites or different disc releases (DVD, LaserDisc, BluRay, etc).

- **WEB-DL**: Untouched videos, downloaded from streaming sites without encoding
- **WEB-Rip**: Videos sourced from streaming sites that went through screen-capture and/or encoding methods
- **BDMV**: A capture of the raw file structure of a BluRay disc, needs to be mounted as a disc in order to be played and is used for making encodes or remuxes.
- **Remux**: Videos sourced from disc releases without encoding, making them have very high quality and file sizes.
- **Encode**: A video that has gone through lossless or lossy compression processes in order to save file size, also called a DVDRip of BDRip.
- **Re-Encode**: An encode that has gone through the process of further encoding, thus degrading in quality.
- **Mini-Encode**: A video where the priority is the smallest possible file size, even if the quality would greatly suffer as a result.

#### Resolution
The number of pixels contained in each frame, a higher value means improved quality (unless it's an upscaled release). The most common ones are 360p, 480p, 720p, 1080p, 2160p. Most anime nowadays are made in 1080p. So, most of the 2160p anime are interpolated. This interpolation causes artifacts and noise.

#### Video Codec
The encoding process for the video file. The most popular ones today are **x264** (AVC) and **x265** (HEVC), with the latter being newer and able to achieve higher compression rates with less quality loss.

#### Audio Format
Used in the encoding process for encoding audio, divided into lossless and lossy formats.

- **Lossless**: These retain the  highest audio quality and have larger file sizes as a consequence. The most common ones are DTS, PCM, WMA and FLAC.
- **Lossy**: These formats aim to provide good quality while retaining smaller sizes. The most popular ones today are AAC, AC3, EAC3 (all commonly found in Web releases), with MP3 being found in older releases.

#### Subtitles
- **Raw**: A video wtihout subtitles.
- **Fansubs**: Unofficial aka fan-made translations.
- **Hardsubs**: Subtitles that are burned into the frames and are part of the video track itself, can't be turned off.
- **Softsubs**: Subtitles that are contained on their own track inside a video file or a separate file that's loaded with the video, can be turned on or off.

#### File Hash
A unique string of letters and numbers that’s calculated for each file, used to check its integrity and origin. An example would be 7BAAC64C.

#### Video Format
The container used for the video file, with the most widely used one today being **MKV**, for the ability to put miltiple audio/subtitle tracks in one video file. The most popular one in the past was **MP4**, focused on being compatible with a wide range of devices, but only being able to have burned-in hardsubs.

## Manga

#### Publisher
The publisher can be mainly two types.
- **CaaS(Chapters as a Service)**: These sites release chapters indvidually instead of volume. Examples: Manga Plus, Manga UP!, Comikey, Tapas etc.
- **Volume**: Sells the whole volume with better quality. Example: VIZ, Kodansha, Square Enix etc.

#### Source
Nowadays the primary source is digital, since it's is easier to rip, higher quality and more common. But there can be scanned versions too.

#### Uploader
The ripper of the manga. Sometimes, it can be more than one person too. Also, if the manga is scanlated, the scanlation group is credited here.

#### f
It indicated this is a fixed version after the initial upload.

#### Format
CBZ is the most common file format for manga. CBZ is just a Zip container. There are also CBR(RAR), CB7(7zip), PDF, ePub etc. The image files inside is generally jpeg and png.
