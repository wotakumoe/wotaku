:::details Why is my torrent not downloading?
There are a few possible causes: the torrent currently has 0 seeders, it has 1 seeder with a bad/limited connection, or you have bad peering (which could be fixed by using a seedbox or VPN). In the case of 0 or bad seeders, you will have to wait for a new seeder to join, or check if a debrid service has the torrent cached.

:::

:::details What is seedbox & debrid service?
### Seedbox
A seedbox is a remote service that can download (leech) & upload (seed) from p2p networks. Since it's always online, it keeps the torrents alive, thus helping you keep a high ratio in [PTs](#pt-private-tracker). Examples: [Ultra.cc](https://ultra.cc/), [RapidSeedbox](https://www.rapidseedbox.com/) & [Pulsed Media](https://pulsedmedia.com/).

### Debrid
Like a seedbox, it's also a remote service. It can download from p2p and various host sites (e.g. [MEGA](https://mega.io/), [RapidGator](https://rapidgators.net/)). One of the big differences is that they (generally) don't seed p2p files and keep the downloaded files cached on their servers, meaning you can download currently dead torrents that have already been cached in the past. Example: [AllDebrid](https://alldebrid.com/) & [Debrid-Link](https://debrid-link.com/).

:::details What does a VPN do?
Watch [**Tom Scott's video**](https://youtu.be/WVDQEoe6ZWY) for an honest explanation.

:::

:::details Do I need VPN while torrenting?

The distribution (here seeding / uploading) of pirated content is illegal. In peer-to-peer (P2P) connections such as torrenting, it exposes your IP to everyone connected. So, it's advisable to use a VPN which will mask your IP. But if your country / ISP doesn't care about pirating stuff, you can skip VPN. To know whether your country / ISP cares about it, ask in your local forum.

:::details What VPN should I use? Free or Paid?
Paid. Check our [VPN section](/qs#vpn).
