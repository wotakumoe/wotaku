Transcoding means converting/encoding audio files from one format to another. In this guide, we will discuss the basics and procedures of transcoding audio files. For the transcoding, we will use [**foobar2000**](https://www.foobar2000.org/) but the process should be similar in other programs also.

::: tip Before starting
[**Read audio glossary**](/glossary/audio) before starting, if you don't have any idea what you are doing.

## The Process

::: danger Read before transcoding {open}
- Audio can't be legitimately transcoded to higher quality since you can't generate new details after compression has been applied. That's why you shouldn't transcode
  -  lossy into another lossy because you will lose more details during transcoding
  -  lossy into lossless since it will be just a waste of space & no audio quality improvement.
