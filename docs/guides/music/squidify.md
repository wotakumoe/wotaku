Squidify is a public music streaming service that offers a vast collection of Anime, Video Game, Movie & TV Soundtracks. You listen to your music collection from any browser or mobile device. Squidify is compatible with the Subsonic/Airsonic API, allowing you to use a wide range of third-party mobile apps to access your music.
