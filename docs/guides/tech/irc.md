IRC (Internet Relay Chat) is a real-time messaging protocol, while XDCC (eXtended DCC) is a method used on IRC to facilitate file sharing through direct client-to-client connections. In this guide, we explained how to use bots in IRC.
<br>

## Getting Started
1. Install an [**IRC Client**](#irc-client) on your device.
2. Go to a [**XDCC Packlists**](#xdcc-packlists) and search for your content
3. Click on the search result for the command message 

**Standard XDCC command** `/msg [bot name] xdcc send #[packet number]`


1. Join the server and the channel of the bot and send the command message
2. It will show a pop up for the download.
