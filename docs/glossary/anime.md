:::details Cour, Season, Split-cour {open}
In Japanese TV, the broadcast schedule is divided into four seasons: Spring (March -- May), Summer (June -- August), Autumn (September -- November), and Winter (December -- February). This means that an anime can have 13 episodes in each season.

- **Cour:** Each 13eps/season is called a cour.
- **Season:** The continuous run of an anime is called a season. It can be a 1 cour (Example: [Chainsaw Man](https://anilist.co/anime/127230/Chainsaw-Man)), 2 cour anime (Example: [Kimetsu no Yaiba](https://anilist.co/anime/101922/Kimetsu-no-Yaiba)) or a 4 cour (Example: [Naruto](https://anilist.co/anime/20/NARUTO))
- **Split-cour:** When the anime season isn't continuous and has a break of one or two cours. Example: [Spy x Family](https://anilist.co/anime/142838/SPYFAMILY-Part-2)

## Technical terms

### Sakuga
Sakuga means drawing, animation. In the fan community, it generally means cool sequences.

### Settai
Settai is collection of model sheets and important places (can be a house, place or anything important). The designs go through multiple stages, so they can change over time. The final drawings are used by staff as the character standard. Depending on the budget, settai can have very high details.

![Akebi-chan no Sailor-fuku](/glossary/anime/akb.webp)

### E-Konte
E-Konte / storyboard shows all the sequences in rough sketches so the director can show the vision to the animators and organize accordingly. It generally has 5 columns:
1. Scene & cut number
2. Scene rough drawing
3. Animation instructions
4. Dialogue & SFX
5. Time & frame number

Formatting of a storyboard can change depending on the studio and director.

### Genga
Genga means tie-down drawings or raw keyframes, drawn by genga artists. The drawn genga goes though a multi-step process.

![](/glossary/anime/genga.webp)

Genga generally goes for important details of a scene. It can be just the character (or part of the character) or the character and their surrounding if the character is interacting with it. Genga doesn't generally include frame in-betweens, so it will be rough in motion by nature.

::: details Short note

If you look at the sakuga, we can see a few numbers.
- **160** -> Scene number
- **01** -> Time (in seconds) of that scene
- **16** -> Shot number of that scene

We tried to really simplify the process. For more details, check out [**Dong Chang**](https://www.youtube.com/@DongChang), [**Sakuga Foundry**](https://www.youtube.com/@SakugaFoundry) & [Iwane Masaaki’s Animating Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@animator).

### Douga
More cleaned up frames, done by key animators. Dougas are way more completed and have more shading in general. The final animation looks pretty close to douga. In-betweens are also added in this step. Sometime, genga and douga can look pretty close depending on the artist.

### Shiage
This is the final step. All the frames are colored and minor issues get fixed.

## File Naming

### Release group
The individual or team behind the release, also called Encoder in the case of encodes. Example: SubsPlease, Erai-raws, EMBER, Yameii, etc. Sometimes, the release group name is mentioned at the end.

### Source
The origin of the release, so streaming sites or different disc releases (DVD, LaserDisc, Blu-ray, etc.).

- **WEB-DL**: Untouched videos, downloaded from streaming sites without encoding
- **WEB-Rip**: Videos sourced from streaming sites that went through screen-capture and/or encoding methods
- **BDISO**: A disk image of a Blu-ray disc, needs to be mounted in order to be played (like other ISOs) and is used for making encodes or remuxes.
- **BDMV**: Short for “Blu-ray Disc Movie”, a container format used to store high-definition video, audio, and other related content on Blu-ray discs.
- **Remux**: Videos sourced from disc releases without encoding, making them have very high quality and file sizes.
- **Encode**: A video that has gone through lossless or lossy compression processes in order to save file size, also called a DVDRip or BDRip.
- **Re-Encode**: An encode that has gone through the process of further encoding, thus degrading in quality.
- **Mini-Encode**: A video where the priority is the smallest possible file size, even if the quality would greatly suffer as a result.

### Resolution
The number of pixels contained in each frame, a higher value means improved quality (unless it's an upscaled release). The most common ones are 360p, 480p, 576p, 720p, 1080p, and 2160p. Most anime nowadays are made in 1080p. So, most of the 2160p anime are interpolated. This interpolation can cause artifacts, over sharpening, or aggressive denoising since it's not really possible to add details out of nothing.

### Video Codec
The encoding process for the video file. The most popular encoders today are **x264** (AVC) and **x265** (HEVC), with the latter being newer and able to achieve higher compression rates with less quality loss.

::: info More about encoding
To learn more about encoding, visit [**Codec Wiki**](https://wiki.x266.mov/docs/introduction/prologue).
:::


### Audio Format
Used in the encoding process for encoding audio, divided into lossless and lossy formats.

- **Lossless**: These retain the highest audio quality and have larger file sizes as a consequence. The most common one is FLAC.
- **Lossy**: These formats aim to provide good quality while keeping file sizes small. The most popular ones today are AAC, AC3, EAC3 (all commonly found in Web releases), with MP3 being found in older releases.

### Subtitles
- **Raw**: A video without subtitles.
- **Fansubs**: Unofficial aka fan-made translations or an edited version of the official subtitle.
- **Hardsubs**: Subtitles that are burned into the frames and are part of the video track itself, can't be turned off.
- **Softsubs**: Subtitles that are contained on their own track inside a video file or a separate file that's loaded with the video, can be turned on or off.

### File Hash
These are [CRC32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) codes, used to detect errors during file transmission. For example: 7BAAC64C. CRC generates a 32-bit code for each file (in hexadecimal, it's 8 digits). Fansubbers include these codes in the filename so that users can easily [check](https://animechecker.sourceforge.net/) whether the downloaded file is corrupted or not. If the file is corrupted, the user will receive a different code than the one written in the file name.

### Video Format
The container used for the video file, with the most widely used one today being **MKV**, for the ability to put multiple audio/subtitle tracks in one video file. The most popular one in the past was **MP4**, which focused on being compatible with a wide range of devices, but was only able to have burned-in hardsubs.


## Subtitle types

| Type                              | Description                                                                                                             |
|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Closed Captions (CC)              | Also known as soft subtitles; text overlays on a video that provide translated dialogue or just audio transcription in case they're following the dub; can be turned off if not needed. |
| Open Captions (OC)                | Also known as burned-in/hard subtitles; non-interactive subtitles that have been permanently 'burned' into the video file itself and can't be turned off. |
| SDH (Subtitles for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing) | A type of subtitle that includes not only dialogue but also annotations for sound effects and other audio information to aid viewers who are deaf or hard of hearing. |
| Forced Subtitles                  | Subtitles that automatically appear when a portion of dialogue or text is in a different language from the main audio track; they are 'forced' on screen to provide necessary translation or context. |
| Karaoke Subtitles                 | Karaoke subtitles highlight the lyrics in time with the Opening/Ending/Insert songs.                            |
