# Submitting a link

## ⛔️ Things we won't add in the wiki

1. Websites that are only or primarily for generative AI (Chatbot, roleplaying bot, ai art generator
   etc.)
2. Sites that
   - imitate other websites
   - have very small libraries
   - only feature MTL'd works
   - are mostly paywalled
   - sell unofficial merch
   - exclusively sell sex toys
3. Adult content sites similar to OnlyFans
4. Software that's too general (for example Windows OS related or Tweaking for privacy)
5. Sites focused on lolicon or furry stuff
6. Sites scraping only one or two common sources, such as HiAnime or Animepahe
7. Sites found in the Unsafe lists of [FMHY](https://fmhy.net/unsafesites), [Privateersclub](https://megathread.pages.dev/unsafe) and/or [r/PiratedGames](https://rentry.org/pgames#untrusted-sites)

## ⚠️ Things we will try to avoid

1. Closed source software (with good FOSS alternatives)
2. Sites that only use hosters such Katfile, Nitroflare, DDownload and Rapidgator
3. Sites that aren't primarily for anime, but have it as a side product
4. Things that are too niche and/or have a small userbase
